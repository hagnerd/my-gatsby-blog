Some backstory...

While going through the Freecodecamp Curriculum there have been a few snags for me. 

Early on it was hard for me to go through the Responsive Design portion, not because it was difficult, but because by the time I started to take Freecodecamp seriously I had already dipped my toes into more complex programming with JavaScript, and I had discovered frameworks (like React). Eventually I pushed through the desire to skip the project portion of that section and just got it done. 

A lot of my designs aren't pretty, mostly becuase I am not a designer, and I have no desire to be one. But I did it because I know that being able to show those skills in a portfolio are important.

When I got to the Front End Framework portion I was in heaven. I was using React, and learned how to use Redux (although I didn't use it for any of the projects in that portion, it felt a bit like overkill). I love the concepts in React, small api, leans towards functional programming ideals, and encourages modularity through components. 

Sidenote: I will have to write further about why I chose not to use Redux in any of the Front End Framework projects. 

Then the algorithms section. Once again, I loved it. It was puzzles and problem solving.   

## The Dreaded Data Visualization
I skipped the data visualization section altogether. There was just something about it that didn't sit well with me. Maybe the choice of library (d3) but that is pretty much the defacto data viz library in JavaScript. 

Maybe it was that the first few lessons didn't grab me. I skipped to the projects but clearly, because I hadn't been using d3, I had no idea how to do what it was asking me. 

I learn better by building things, than by reading about someone else building things so a tutorial was out. 

So I've decided to build some small things with D3, and ramp up the difficulty. I'm going through the lessons on Freecodecamp and taking notes which I will post here. The end goal for me is to be comfortable with D3, and the underlying principles, and eventually learn and use VX which is a library of React components that interfaces with D3.
