Since Thoughtbot released all of the Upcase course material for free, I decided to go through some of the courses. I've been a fan of Vim for a long time, and have been using Vim for about a year now, but I always feel like there is more I can learn. I decided to take their Onramp to Vim course.

Some small bits I learned in conjunction with configuration:

nmap = normal mode map
imap = insert mode map
<cr> = carriage return, without it at the end of a map, the command will hang waiting for you to press return. This can be used to your advantage if that is what you intend
